# blob-landing-page | [Preview](https://naokoaf.github.io/blob-landing-page/)
I wanted to experiment with using animated little blobs for a cool website design, so I made this thing.

The blobs were generated using a combination of [Processing](https://processing.org/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (The code for those isn't here because its absolutely terrible to use atm)
